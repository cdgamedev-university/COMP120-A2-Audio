#COMP120 Tinkering Audio
#Contract 2 - Ambient Platformers Audio Generation (Diegetic Audio)

Our contract requires us to generate ambient audio tracks so that a player feels as though they're in 
differentareas of the game's setting. Hayley Davies and myself have implimented 7 algorithms which 
will be used to meet the criteria on this contract.

This is a form program loads audio files from the user, and then manipulates the sound files use the algorithms.

Instructions:
1. Open visual studio and load the form file
2. Press start on visual studio and run the form.
3. Press Load File and choose a file to load

*** Currently the program is still a work in progress,  ***
*** we suggest you look into the code to judge progress *** 
*** and the form itself					***
